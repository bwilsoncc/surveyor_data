"""

In Portal, this data was originally published as a query layer (called Surveys2 or Surveys_2)  
with an complex SQL query that was very slow.

Now it's this Pandas dataframe code that no one understands. But it's fast!!

Old workflow: 
Walk the directory tree and build a table
Update SurveyImages table from changes in the directory tree table
Generate the HYPERLINK<n> columns using SQL in a query layer (slow on display)

New workflow:
Walk the directory tree and create a dataframe
Update SurveyImages from the dataframe
Generate a hosted layer that has the HYPERLINK<n> and SURVEY<n> columns in it.
Use the SURVEY<n> attribute in the popup. 
Generating the hosted layer is slowish but rendering it is fast.

VERSIONING - for now I am assuming that this will ignore versioning and use sde.DEFAULT.
An option to use a branch might be nice someday so that the data could be previewed before publishing.
